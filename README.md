## Projects
### Sentiment-Driven Classification of Footwear Reviews of Amazon
[Publication](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarak369/classification-based-on-sentiment-analysis)

Developed a sophisticated analysis framework that can accurately classify customer reviews into three distinct sentiment categories: good, bad, and neutral. By achieving a granular understanding of customer sentiments associated with each
product, this project seeks to contribute significantly to the development of advanced recommender systems.

### American Healthcare: Visualizing the Digital Threat 
![EEG Band Discovery](/images/healthcarecomplianceproscom_645624885.jpg)
This data originates from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights portal, encompassing healthcare data breaches across various locations in the United States from Oct 2009 to Sep 2021
Aim:To uncover patterns and insights that can help understand the prevalent vulnerabilities within the healthcare sector, particularly regarding data security.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models that estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
