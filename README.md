### American Healthcare: Visualizing the Digital Threat 
![EEG Band Discovery](/images/healthcarecomplianceproscom_645624885.jpg)
This data originates from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights portal, encompassing healthcare data breaches across various locations in the United States from Oct 2009 to Sep 2021
#Aim : To uncover patterns and insights that can help understand the prevalent vulnerabilities within the healthcare sector, particularly regarding data security.
[Tableau Public viz](https://public.tableau.com/views/HealthDataBreachesVisualization/HealthDataBreachDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
This Interactive Dashboard has been evidencing the most are the tradeoffs of highly centralized data, in our visualization there is some clear dichotomy between high tech breaches that are few and far between but very impactful, and minor breaches that make up the majority of events but don’t make the news. Whether it be on the storage end or the breaching, higher tech systems and attackers involved in breaches end up with far more victims and less frequency. Our clearest example of this is the 2015 Indiana breach of Anthem Inc. which had a very apparent sway over the data, reshaping charts as soon as it got filtered. This is seen clearly in the stacked bar charts, as their forms are completely changed without the Anthem breach. This is an outlier but it's no coincidence that by far the largest data point was a hacking event on a network server, the two traits that tend towards the largest leakages, our visualizations with outlier free versions suggest that the measure of individuals affected is majority controlled by digital leaks whether the Anthem breach is removed or not. Another important takeaway from this report is the steady increase in breaches in recent years, although the severity of breaches doesn’t seem to be increasing but the trend of hacking in linear and other and unkown types of Breach are dropping indicating the positive sign of advancement in indentying the Potential causes and reasons behind breaches.
